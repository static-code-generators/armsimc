### Workflow

1. Small feature gets assigned to a person after group meeting
2. The person implements it in a separate branch and then sends PR to master
3. The PR needs review by any other member, and if okayed by them, can be merged into master
4. If no reply on PR till 36 hours by anyone, it can be merged into master
5. PR should have no merge conflicts, it's responsibility of the PR-sender to keep their branch updated to master

(Should we rather have maintainers for each submodule, and make them have final say on accepting PRs?)
